# Metapolis - A new take on city-builder games

Metapolis is a big project with the idea of creating a new type of city-builder game integrated into the Polygon blockchain. The main difference from current city-builder games is that we utilize web3 technologies to enable an economy centered around the cities players build. This also makes it possible to organize tournaments and other fun activities with real cash prizes. The game is meant to be free to play with optional microtransactions handled on the Polygon network.

## Gameplay

- Metapolis is an interactive NFT game where each player builds their own NFT from the bottom up, at their own pace.
- Each player starts with a foundation of 20x20 plots, and a few random buildings/landmarks.
- Buildings can be upgraded to a higher level, making them better for the city.
- The city has to maintain a balance of happy citizens, a clean environment, and a productive economy to maximize progress.
- There are many types of buildings and each can impact the value of the NFT.
- The best-performing Metapolis NFTs are rewarded with badges and other rewards regularly.
- The players can purchase rare landmarks and buildings that increase the value of their Metapolis NFT.
